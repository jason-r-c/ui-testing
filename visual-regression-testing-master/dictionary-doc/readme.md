## Summary

Update 2/5/19

File watcher in document-gen-watcher no longer used.

Now compiling documentation manually - see '## Compiling gherkin doc' in the main readme.md

Gets the comments marked with @anthropos-gherkin and adds them to a text file called dictionary.txt

## File to use
groovydocgenthree.groovy contains the latest working version. The other files contain older works and should act as reference material.

## Document generate watcher
The Gherkin documentation for the project can be automatically generated by running the node script file-watcher.js. This watches for saves made to the Utilities.groovy file.

### Usage
From the terminal, head into `docuument-gen-watcher` and run `node file-watcher.js`

You should get ouput that looks like the below

```
$ node file-watcher.js
